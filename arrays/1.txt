1.	Implement all common array operations that includes traversal like finding maximum, minimum, sum, product, linear search, reverse array. (do all this solution in single class and try to reuse the loop for function).

2.	Write a code that swaps every alternate index element in an array.
 	If array = [10,20,30,40,50] => output array => [20,10,40,30,50]
 	If array = [10,20,30,40,50,60] => output array => [20,10,40,30,60,50]

3.	Find unique value in odd size array. Every other element is present twice in array only a single value there with 1 occurrence. Return that value.

4. Find duplicate value in array which contains 1 to n-1 values. You can also consider the same problem which doesn't contain 1 to n-1 values.
    If array = [1,3,2,4,3] => output => 3
 	If array = [1,2,3,2] => output  => 2

5. Find Intersection of 2 sorted arrays. Intersection means the same elements both arrays can have
	If array-1 = [1,2,5,7] and array-2 = [5,6,7] => output => [5,7]
 	If array-1 = [1,2,3,4,5] and array-2 = [5,6] => output => [5]
